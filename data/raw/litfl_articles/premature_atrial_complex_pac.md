# Premature Atrial Complex (PAC)

A premature atrial complex (PAC) is a premature beat arising from ectopic pacemaking tissue within the atria. There is an abnormal P wave, usually followed by a normal QRS complex. AKA: Atrial ectopics, atrial extrasystoles, atrial premature beats, atrial premature depolarisations.
- Abnormal (non-sinus) P wave usually followed by a normal QRS complex (< 120 ms)
- Unlike with a premature ventricular complexe (PVC), the post-extrasystolic pause is not equal to double the preceding RR interval
- The P wave typically has a different morphology and axis to the sinus P waves
- PACs arising close to the AV node (“low atrial” ectopics) cause retrograde activation of the atria, producing an inverted P wave with a relatively short PR interval ≥ 120 ms (PR interval < 120 ms is classified as a PJC)
- Groups of pacemaker cells throughout the conducting system are capable of spontaneous depolarisation
- The rate of depolarisation decreases from top to bottom: fastest at the sinoatrial node; slowest within the ventricles
- Ectopic impulses from subsidiary pacemakers are normally suppressed by more rapid impulses from above
- Premature contractions (“ectopics”) are classified by their origin — atrial (PAC), junctional (PJC) or ventricular (PVC)
- Unifocal – arising from a single ectopic focus; each PAC is identical.
- Multifocal – arising from two or more ectopic foci; multiple P-wave morphologies.
PACs often occur in repeating patterns:
- Bigeminy — every other beat is a PAC
- Trigeminy — every third beat is a PAC
- Quadrigeminy — every fourth beat is a PAC
- Couplet – two consecutive PACs
- Triplet — three consecutive PACs
- PACs are a normal electrophysiological phenomenon not usually requiring investigation or treatment

- Sympathomimetics
- Beta-agonists
- Excess caffeine
- Hypokalaemia
- Hypomagnesaemia
- Digoxin toxicity
- Myocardial ischaemia
Blocked PAC:
- This hidden PAC gives a peaked appearance to the T wave (circled)
- The PAC is not not followed by a QRS complex, indicating that it has not been conducted to the ventricles (“blocked PAC”)
- It is followed by a compensatory pause
Normally and aberrantly-conducted PACs:
- There is an aberrantly conducted PAC, best seen in aVL and aVF (circled)
- This could be mistaken for a ventricular ectopic — however, it is clearly preceded by an abnormal P wave
- A normally-conducted PAC is also present on the rhythm strip (circled)
NB: This rhythm strip is not recorded simultaneously
