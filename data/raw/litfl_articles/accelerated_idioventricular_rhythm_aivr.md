# Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR)

AIVR, also known as Accelerated Ventricular Rhythm, results when the rate of an ectopic ventricular pacemaker exceeds that of the sinus node. Often associated with increased vagal tone and decreased sympathetic tone.
- Regular rhythm
- Rate typically 50-120 bpm
- Three or more ventricular complexes; QRS duration > 120ms
- Fusion and capture beats
- AIVR is classically seen in the reperfusion phase of an acute STEMI, e.g. post thrombolysis
- Usually a well-tolerated, benign, self-limiting arrhythmia
Note that the rate of AIVR distinguishes it from others rhythms of similar morphology:
- Rates < 50 bpm are consistent with a Ventricular Escape Rhythm
- Rates > 110 bpm are consistent with Ventricular Tachycardia
There are multiple causes of AIVR including:
- Reperfusion phase of acute myocardial infarction (MI) — most common cause
- Beta-sympathomimetics such as isoprenaline or adrenaline
- Drug toxicity, especially digoxin, cocaine and volatile anaesthetics such as desflurane
- Electrolyte abnormalities
- Cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, myocarditis
- Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following cardiac arrest — this probably relates to reperfusion of acute MI as underlying cause of arrest
- Athletic heart
- AIVR is a benign rhythm in most settings and does not usually require treatment
- Usually self limiting and resolves when sinus rate exceeds that of the ventricular foci
- Treat the underlying cause: e.g. correct electrolytes, restore myocardial perfusion
This refers to AV dissociation with sinus and ventricular complexes occurring at identical rates. This is in contrast to complete heart block, where the atrial rate is usually faster than the ventricular rate.
Isorhythmic AV dissociation is usually due to functional block at the AV node due to retrograde ventricular impulses. These ventricular impulses depolarise the AV node, leaving it refractory to incoming sinus impulses (= “interference-dissociation”). Identical rates in isorhythmic AV dissociation can create the illusional of an association between the two chambers.
- Ventricular rhythm at 60 bpm
- Multiple sinus capture beats
Competing sinus and idioventricular pacemakers are present. There is an underlying sinus arrhythmia, with sinus capture occurring when the sinus rate exceeds the idioventricular rate.
This patient was a healthy 36-year old marathon runner with presumably very high resting vagal tone causing sinus bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia.
Another ECG from the same patient showing:
- AIVR at 60 bpm
- Isorhythmic AV dissociation with frequent sinus capture beats
- A fusion beat
- Ventricular rhythm at 75 bpm
- AV dissociation — a dissociated P wave is seen in the rhythm strip (after 9th complex), another in lead aVL. Elsewhere, dissociated P waves cause intermittent deformation of the QRS complexes
- The taller left rabbit ear sign is present — there is a notched R wave in V1 with a taller initial R wave; this is highly specific for a ventricular origin of the QRS complexes
- Broad complex at 90 bpm
- No visible P waves
This dysrhythmia occurred following reperfusion from an anterior STEMI.
- Ventricular tachycardia
