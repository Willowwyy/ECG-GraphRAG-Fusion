# Wellens Syndrome

- Chris Nickson
OVERVIEW
- Wellens Syndrome = high grade LAD or LM coronary lesion
CRITERIA
- history of chest pain
- chest pain with a normal looking ECG (pseudonormalisation)
- minimally elevated cardiac enzymes
- no pathological precordial Q waves or loss of R wave progression
- pain free ST elevation in V2 and V3 (minimally elevated)
- pain free symmetrical deep T wave inversion or biphasic T waves in V2-V5
Two types
Type A – 25%
- pain free: biphasic T waves in the anterior leads
- during pain: paradoxical pseudonormalisation of ST segments
- needs to be recognized because it will cause anterior MI within 9 days (if not dealt to by PCI or CABG)
Type B – 75%
- deep symmetrical T wave inversion in I and aVL
- chest leads: 1mm of ST elevation
