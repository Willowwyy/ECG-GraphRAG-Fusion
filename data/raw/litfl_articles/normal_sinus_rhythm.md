# Normal Sinus Rhythm

- The default heart rhythm
- Pacemaking impulses arise from the sino-atrial node and are transmitted to the ventricles via the AV-node and His-Purkinje system
- This results in a regular, narrow-complex heart rhythm at 60-100 bpm
- Regular rhythm at a rate of 60-100 bpm (or age-appropriate rate in children)
- Each QRS complex is preceded by a normal P wave
- Normal P wave axis: P waves upright in leads I and II, inverted in aVR
- The PR interval remains constant
- QRS complexes < 100 ms wide (unless co-existent interventricular conduction delay present)
- Newborn: 110 – 150 bpm
- 2 years: 85 – 125 bpm
- 4 years: 75 – 115 bpm
- 6 years+: 60 – 100 bpm
- Sinus tachycardia = sinus rhythm with resting heart rate > 100 bpm in adults, or above the normal range for age in children
- Sinus bradycardia = sinus rhythm with resting heart rate < 60 bpm in adults, or below the normal range for age in children
- Sinus arrhythmia = sinus rhythm with a beat-to-beat variation in the P-P interval (the time between successive P waves), producing an irregular ventricular rate
Normal sinus rhythm in a healthy 18-year old male:
- Regular rhythm at 84 bpm.
- Normal P wave morphology and axis (upright in I and II, inverted in aVR)
- Narrow QRS complexes (< 100 ms wide)
- Each P wave is followed by a QRS complex
- The PR interval is constant
- The P wave
- Sinus arrhythmia
- Sinus bradycardia
- Sinus tachycardia
