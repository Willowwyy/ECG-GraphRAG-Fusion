# AV Block: 2nd degree, Mobitz II (Hay block)

A form of 2nd degree AV block in which there is intermittent non-conducted P waves without progressive prolongation of the PR interval
- The PR interval in the conducted beats remains constant
- The P waves ‘march through’ at a constant rate
- The RR interval surrounding the dropped beat(s) is an exact multiple of the preceding RR interval (e.g. double the preceding RR interval for a single dropped beat, triple for two dropped beats, etc)
- Mobitz II is usually due to failure of conduction at the level of the His-Purkinje system (i.e. below the AV node)
- While Mobitz I is usually due to a functional suppression of AV conduction (e.g. due to drugs, reversible ischaemia), Mobitz II is more likely to be due to structural damage to the conducting system (e.g. infarction, fibrosis, necrosis)
- Patients typically have a pre-existing LBBB or bifascicular block, and the 2nd degree AV block is produced by intermittent failure of the remaining fascicle (“bilateral bundle-branch block”)
- In around 75% of cases, the conduction block is located distal to the Bundle of His, producing broad QRS complexes.
- In the remaining 25% of cases, the conduction block is located within the His Bundle itself, producing narrow QRS complexes.
- Unlike Mobitz I, which is produced by progressive fatigue of the AV nodal cells, Mobitz II is an “all or nothing” phenomenon whereby the His-Purkinje cells suddenly and unexpectedly fail to conduct a supraventricular impulse.
- Anterior MI (due to septal infarction with necrosis of the bundle branches)
- Idiopathic fibrosis of the conducting system (Lenègre-Lev disease)
- Cardiac surgery, especially surgery occurring close to the septum e.g. mitral valve repair
- Inflammatory conditions (rheumatic fever, myocarditis, Lyme disease)
- Autoimmune (SLE, systemic sclerosis)
- Infiltrative myocardial disease (amyloidosis, haemochromatosis, sarcoidosis)
- Hyperkalaemia
- Drugs: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, amiodarone
- Mobitz II is much more likely than Mobitz I to be associated with haemodynamic compromise, severe bradycardia and progression to 3rd degree heart block
- The risk of asystole is around 35% per year
- Mobitz II mandates immediate admission for cardiac monitoring, backup temporary pacing and ultimately insertion of a permanent pacemaker
