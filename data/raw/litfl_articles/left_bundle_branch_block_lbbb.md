# Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB)

- QRS duration ≥ 120ms
- Dominant S wave in V1
- Broad monophasic R wave in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5-6)
- Absence of Q waves in lateral leads
- Prolonged R wave peak time > 60ms in leads V5-6
Associated features include:
- Left axis deviation (LAD);
- Poor R wave progression in precordial leads, and
- Appropriate discordance (discussed below)
In normal cardiac conduction, impulses travel equally down the left and right bundles, with the septum activated from left to right and the formation of small Q waves in lateral leads
- In LBBB, conduction delay means that impulses travel first via the right bundle branch to the RV, and then to the LV via the septum
- Septal activation is thus reversed eliminating lateral Q waves
- The overall depolarisation vector from the right to left ventricle produces tall R waves in lateral leads (I, V5-6) and deep S waves in the right precordial leads (V1-3). The delay between activation of the RV and LV produces the characteristic “M-shaped” R wave seen in lateral leads
- Delayed overall conduction time to the LV extends the QRS duration to ≥ 120 ms
- rS complex (small R wave, deep S wave)
- QS complex (deep Q/S wave with no preceding R wave)
- Appropriate discordance refers to the fact that abnormal depolarisation should be followed by abnormal repolarisation, which appears discordant to the preceding QRS complex
- Lateral leads with tall, broad R waves will often have associated ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion, and those with deep S waves can have an allowable amount of ST elevation that does not indicate ischaemia (generally viewed as < 25% of the size of the preceding S wave)
- Any concordant ST segment change is concerning for ischaemia. For further reading, see LITFL: Sgarbossa Criteria
It is unusual for LBBB to exist in the absence of organic disease. Causes are varied and include:
- Aortic stenosis
- Ischaemic heart disease
- Hypertension
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Anterior MI
- Lenègre-Lev disease: primary degenerative disease (fibrosis) of the conducting system
- Hyperkalaemia
- Digoxin toxicity
New LBBB in the context of chest pain was once considered a “STEMI-equivalent” and part of the criteria for thrombolysis. However, more up-to-date data suggests that chest pain patients with new LBBB have little increased risk of acute myocardial infarction at the time of presentation.
Practice has now evolved to examining for excessive discordance or concordant ST segment changes indicative of infarction.
Broad notched R waves are best appreciated in leads aVL and I here. There is absence of Q waves in leads V5-6.
LBBB with AF. Note deep S waves in leads V1-3 and tall broad R waves laterally. Appropriate discordance is present.
Incomplete LBBB is diagnosed when typical LBBB morphology is associated with a QRS duration <120ms.
- Right ventricular paced rhythms will produce a similiar morphology, as impulse conductions originate from the RV and travel across the septum to the LV as is the case in LBBB. Pacing spikes will be present. The same concepts regarding appropriate discordance apply.
