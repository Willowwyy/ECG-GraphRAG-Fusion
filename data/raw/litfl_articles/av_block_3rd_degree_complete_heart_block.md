# AV block: 3rd degree (complete heart block)

- Severe bradycardia due to absence of AV conduction
- The ECG demonstrates complete AV dissociation, with independent atrial and ventricular rates
- Complete heart block is essentially the end point of either Mobitz I or Mobitz II AV block
- The former is more likely to respond to atropine and has a better overall prognosis
The causes are the same as for Mobitz I and Mobitz II second degree heart block. The most important aetiologies are:
- Inferior myocardial infarction
- AV-nodal blocking drugs (e.g. calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, digoxin)
- Idiopathic degeneration of the conducting system (Lenegre’s or Lev’s disease), causing true trifascicular block
Clinical significance
- Patients with third degree heart block are at high risk of ventricular standstill and sudden cardiac death
- They require urgent admission for cardiac monitoring, backup temporary pacing and usually insertion of a permanent pacemaker
Complete heart block should not be confused with:
- High grade AV block: A type of severe second degree heart block with a very slow ventricular rate but still some evidence of occasional AV conduction
Complete Heart Block:
- Atrial rate is ~ 85 bpm
- Ventricular rate is ~ 38 bpm
- None of the atrial impulses appear to be conducted to the ventricles
- Rhythm is maintained by a junctional escape rhythm
- Marked inferior ST elevation indicates that the cause is an inferior STEMI
Complete Heart Block:
- Atrial rate is ~ 60 bpm
- Ventricular rate is ~ 27 bpm
- None of the atrial impulses appear to be conducted to the ventricles
- There is a slow ventricular escape rhythm
Complete Heart Block:
- Atrial rate 100 bpm
- Ventricular rate only 15 bpm!
- This patient needs urgent treatment with atropine / isoprenaline and pacing!
Complete Heart Block with Isorhythmic AV Dissociation (long rhythm strip):
- Atrial rate ~ 85 bpm
- Ventricular rate ~ 42bpm
- There is a junctional escape rhythm
- As the ventricular rate is approximately half the atrial rate, this rhythm at first glance appears to be second-degree AV block with 2:1 conduction
- However, on closer inspection, the PR interval varies with some of the P waves superimposed on the QRS complexes. The ventricular rate remains regular
- This confirms that the atrial impulses are not being conducted to the ventricles
- The apparent relationship between the P waves and QRS complexes occurs merely by chance (= isorhythmic AV dissociation)
- AV block: 1st degree
- AV block: 2nd degree, Mobitz I
- AV block: 2nd degree, Mobitz II
- AV block: 2nd degree, “fixed ratio blocks” (2:1, 3:1)
- AV block: 2nd degree, “high grade AV block”
