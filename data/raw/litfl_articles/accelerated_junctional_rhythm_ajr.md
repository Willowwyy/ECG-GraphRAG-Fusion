# Accelerated Junctional Rhythm (AJR)

Accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) occurs when the rate of an AV junctional pacemaker exceeds that of the sinus node. This situation arises when there is increased automaticity in the AV node coupled with decreased automaticity in the sinus node.
- Narrow complex rhythm; QRS duration < 120ms (unless pre-existing bundle branch block or rate-related aberrant conduction)
- Ventricular rate usually 60 – 100 bpm
Anything that disrupts electrical activity in the SA node can precipitate AJR. Common causes include:
- Digoxin toxicity (= the classic cause of AJR)
- Beta-agonists, e.g. isoprenaline, adrenaline
- Myocardial ischaemia
- Myocarditis
- Cardiac surgery
Junctional rhythms are arbitrarily classified by their rate:
- Junctional bradycardia: < 40 bpm
- Junctional Escape Rhythm: 40-60 bpm
- Accelerated Junctional Rhythm: 60-100 bpm
- Junctional Tachycardia: > 100 bpm
- Automatic Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AJR) = Due to enhanced automaticity in AV nodal cells
- Re-entrant Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AVNRT) = Due to re-entrant loop involving AV node
- Irregularity of rhythm and heart-rate variability are suggestive of automatic junctional tachycardia
Junctional Tachycardia
- Narrow complex tachycardia at 115 bpm
- Retrograde P waves — inverted in II, III and aVF; upright in V1 and aVR
- Short PR interval (< 120 ms) indicates a junctional rather than atrial focus
- AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT)
- Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT)
- Accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR)
