# Ventricular Tachycardia – Monomorphic VT

Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) is a broad complex tachycardia originating from the ventricles. There are several different forms of VT — the most common is monomorphic VT, which originates from a single focus within the ventricles.
- Regular, broad complex tachycardia
- Uniform QRS complexes within each lead — each QRS is identical (except for fusion/capture beats)
Monomorphic VT can be difficult to differentiate from other causes of broad complex tachycardia.
Other ECG features suggestive of VT include:
- Very broad complexes (>160ms)
- Absence of typical RBBB or LBBB morphology
- Extreme axis deviation (“northwest axis”)
- AV dissociation (P and QRS complexes at different rates)
- Capture beats — occur when the sinoatrial node transiently ‘captures’ the ventricles, in the midst of AV dissociation, to produce a QRS complex of normal duration
- Fusion beats — occur when a sinus and ventricular beat coincide to produce a hybrid complex of intermediate morphology
- Positive or negative concordance throughout the chest leads, i.e. leads V1-6 show entirely positive (R) or entirely negative (QS) complexes, with no RS complexes seen
- Josephson’s sign – Notching near the nadir of the S-wave
- Brugada’s sign – The distance from the onset of the QRS complex to the nadir of the S-wave is > 100ms
- RSR’ complexes with a taller “left rabbit ear”. This is the most specific finding in favour of VT. This is in contrast to RBBB, where the right rabbit ear is taller
Below are some examples of positive and negative concordance, and Brugada’s and Josephson’s sign. For more examples of the other suggestive features, see VT versus SVT.
- Ischaemic Heart Disease
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Chaga’s Disease
- The presence of pre-existing poor ventricular function is strongly associated with cardiovascular compromise
- Prompt recognition and initiation of treatment (e.g. electrical cardioversion) is required in all cases of VT
- Haemodynamically stable
- Haemodynamically unstable — e.g hypotension, chest pain, cardiac failure, decreased conscious level
This is the most important classification clinically and influences immediate management.
- Sustained = Duration > 30 seconds, or requiring intervention due to haemodynamic compromise
- Non-sustained = Three or more consecutive ventricular complexes, terminating spontaneously in < 30 seconds
- Monomorphic
- Polymorphic VT
- Torsades De Pointes (Polymorphic with QT prolongation)
- Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Tachycardia
- Fascicular Tachycardia
- Bidirectional VT
- Ventricular Flutter
- Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)
Three mechanisms exist for initiation and propagation of ventricular tachycardia:
- Requires two distinct conduction pathways
- Under normal circumstances, impulses cancel each other out (0)
- Conduction block in one pathway develops due to myocardial scarring, usually as a result of prior ischaemia/infarction (1)
- Strong ventricular impulses from the normal/slowed pathway can re-enter the blocked region (2), creating a re-entry circuit (3)
- Occurs due to early or late after-depolarisations
- Examples include Torsades de Pointes and digitalis toxicity
- Accelerated abnormal impulse generation by a region of ventricular cells
Monomorphic VT:
- Classic monomorphic VT with uniform QRS complexes
- Indeterminate axis
- Very broad QRS (~200 ms)
- Notching near the nadir of the S wave in lead III = Josephson’s sign
Monomorphic VT:
- Very broad QRS complexes (~ 200 ms) with uniform morphology
- Fusion and capture beats are seen in the rhythm strip
- Brugada’s sign is present: the time from the onset of the QRS complex to nadir of S wave is > 100 ms (best seen in V6)
NB: The rhythm strip is recorded after the other 12 leads rather than simultaneously
Monomorphic VT:
- Very broad complexes (~ 200 ms in V5-6)
- Northwest axis (-120 degrees)
- Brugada’s sign — the distance from the onset of the QRS complex to the nadir of the S-wave is > 100ms
- Josephson’s sign — notching near the nadir of the S wave is seen in leads II, III, aVF
- Possibly some superimposed P waves in aVF
Monomorphic VT alternating with ventricular bigeminy.
The ventricular complexes have the following features:
- Very broad QRS duration (> 160 bpm)
- Positive concordance in the precordial leads (dominant R waves in V1-6)
- Brugada’s sign – time from onset of QRS to nadir of S wave > 100 ms; best seen in leads aVR and aVL
Monomorphic VT:
- Extreme axis deviation / northwest axis is present -150 degree; QRS positive in aVR, negative in I + aVF
- -150 degree; QRS positive in aVR, negative in I + aVF
- There is a RBBB-like pattern in V1 with a taller left rabbit ear – this is very specific for VT
Monomorphic VT:
- Northwest axis
- Tall monophasic R wave in V1 with an rS complex in V6 (small R wave, big S wave) — this pattern is also very specific for VT
This ECG fulfils the Brugada Morphology Criteria for VT.
NOTE: in the presence of a dominant R wave in V1 (“RBBB morphology”), VT is diagnosed if:
- There is an RSR’ complex with a taller left rabbit ear
- There is a tall monophasic R wave
- There is an rS complex in V6 (R/S ratio < 1)
See “VT versus SVT with aberrancy” for more details.
Monomorphic VT:
- This ECG is a difficult one!
- Although there is a broad complex tachycardia (HR > 100, QRS > 120), the appearance in V1 is more suggestive of SVT with aberrancy, given that the the complexes are not that broad (< 160 ms) and the right rabbit ear is taller than the left
- However, on closer inspection there are signs of AV dissociation, with superimposed P waves visible in V1
- Also, the presence of a northwest axis and an rS complex in V6 (tiny R wave, deep S wave) indicate that this is VT
Several arrhythmias can present as a wide-complex tachycardia (QRS > 120 ms), including:
- Ventricular Tachycardia
- SVT with aberrant conduction due to bundle branch block
- SVT with aberrant conduction due to the pre-excitation syndromes
- Pace-maker mediated tachycardia
- Metabolic derangements e.g. hyperkalaemia
- Poisoning with sodium-channel blocking agents (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants)
Differentiating between the various causes of wide-complex tachycardia is challenging and not always possible.
- Age > 35 (positive predictive value of 85%)
- Structural heart disease
- Ischaemic heart disease
- Previous MI
- Congestive heart failure
- Cardiomyopathy
- Family history of sudden cardiac death (suggesting conditions such as HOCM, congenital long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia that are associated with episodes of VT)
- A number of diagnostic algorithms exist to help aid in the diagnosis of VT.
- No algorithm is 100% accurate in predicating VT
- Algorithms can be complex and require specific and unfamiliar measurements to be calculated
- Flow charts for the four commonly used algorithms (ACC, Brugada, Ultra-simple Brugada, Vereckei ) can be found over at ECGpedia.org.
Remember
- If in doubt, treat as VT!
