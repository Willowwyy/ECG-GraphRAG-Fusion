# Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB)

- QRS duration > 120ms
- RSR’ pattern in V1-3 (“M-shaped” QRS complex)
- Wide, slurred S wave in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5-6)
Associated features incude:
- Appropriate discordance with ST depression and/or T-wave inversion in right precordial leads (V1-3).
In normal cardiac conduction, impulses travel equally down the left and right bundles, with the septum activated from left to right and the formation of small Q waves in lateral leads
- In RBBB, the left ventricle is activated normally, thus the early part of the QRS complex correlating to septal depolarisation is unchanged
- There is delayed activation of the right ventricle as depolarisation originates from the left ventricle across the septum. This produces a secondary R wave (R’) in the precordial leads, and a wide, slurred S wave in lateral leads
- Normal activation of the left ventricle means that cardiac axis remains normal in isolated RBBB
- Appropriate discordance refers to the fact that abnormal depolarisation should be followed by abnormal repolarisation, which appears discordant to the preceding QRS complex
- In RBBB, this manifests as ST depression and/or T-wave inversion in leads V1-3
- Right ventricular hypertrophy / cor pulmonale
- Pulmonary embolus
- Ischaemic heart disease
- Rheumatic heart disease
- Congenital heart disease (e.g. atrial septal defect)
- Myocarditis
- Cardiomyopathy
- Lenègre-Lev disease: primary degenerative disease (fibrosis) of the conducting system
RBBB with LAFB.
- Broad QRS > 120ms
- Note the prominent delayed RV conduction, manifested as a tall, broad R wave (R’) best seen in lead V1
- Widened S wave is best appreciated in lead I
- There is appropriate discordance in the right precordial leads with T-wave inversion
Isolated RBBB.
- Typical RSR’ pattern in V1-2
- Widened S waves again demonstrated in lateral leads, especially V4-6
- Appropriate discordance in leads V1-2
Isolated RBBB.
- RSR’ pattern in V1-3
- Lateral S wave changed are not evident here
- Note note normal axis in isolated RBBB
RBBB with LAFB in the context of chest pain.
- RBBB is seen with RSR’ pattern in V1-3 and slurred S waves in lateral leads
- There is concordant ST segment changes best seen in V2, and hyper-acute T waves inferiorly. This patient was found to have a 99% proximal LAD occlusion. See OMI: Replacing the STEMI misnomer for further case details
- Incomplete RBBB is defined as an RSR’ pattern in V1-3 with QRS duration < 120ms.
- It is a normal variant, commonly seen in children (of no clinical significance).
