# Ventricular Tachycardia

- Chris Nickson
OVERVIEW
- Ventricular Tachycardia = 3 or more VEB at a rate of > 130 beats/min
- If > 30 seconds = sustained
- can be monophoric or polymorphic
TYPES
Monomorphic
- most common
- associated with MI
Polymorphic
- QRS at 200 beats/min or more which change amplitude and axis so they appear to twist around the baseline
- -> treatment is the same for both
MECHANISMS
- enhanced automaticity (ectopic pacemaker activity)
- enhanced trigger activity
- re-entry
PREDISPOSTING CONDITIONS
Channelopathies (Na+ and K+)
- Lange-Neilsen syndrome (long QT + deafness)
- Romano-Ward syndrome (long QT and no deafness)
- Brugada syndrome
Other electrophysiology effects
- WPW
- catecholamine sensitive polymorphic VT
Drugs that cause QT Prolongation
- clarithromycin
- erythromycin
- metaclopramide
- haloperidol
- TCA
- methadone
- droperidol
Electrolytes
- hypokalaemia
- hyperkalaemia
- hypomagnesaemia
- hypocalcaemia
Hypothermia
Structural heart disease
- LV dysfunction
- coronary artery disease
- HOCM
DIFFERENTIATING VT FROM WIDE COMPLEX SVT
Criteria for diagnosis of VT using the 4-step Brugada algorithm:
(i) Is RS complex present in any lead? -> if NO the rhythm is VT(ii) Is the RS duration >100ms in any lead? -> if YES then the rhythm is VT(iii) Is there AV dissociation? (fusion or capture beats) -> if YES then the rhythm is VT(iv) Is the rhythm morphologically consistent with SVT (looks like RBBB or LBBB)? -> if NO the rhythm is VT
-> fusion beats = complex looks half normal and half abnormal-> capture beats = normal complex seen
MANAGEMENT
PULSELESS
- ACLS protocol
- Immediate unsynchronised defibrillation
- CPR with minimal interruption (30:2, with 2 minute cycles)
- Intubation
- IV access
- Adrenaline 1mg Q3min
- Amiodarone 300mg (following 3rd shock)
- Exclude reversible causes (4 H’s and T’s)
CLINICALLY COMPROMISED
- Haemodynamically unstable, chest pain, ischaemia, heart failure, VR > 150/min -> synchronised shock (x 3)
- IV access
- Rapid exclusion of reversible factors (wire, PA catheter in RV, hypoK+ or Mg2+)
- Amiodarone 5mg/kg -> infusion
- Synchronised DC Shock (50J Bi, 100 Mono)
- Consider:-> procainamide 50mg/min-> lignocaine 1mg/kg-> sotalol 1mg/kg
- Repeat DC Shock (150 Bi, 360 Mono)
- Overdrive pacing
CLINICALLY STABLE
- controversial
- debate between cardioversion and pharmacological treatment
- still a medical emergency as can degenerate into unstable VT and VF
- Amiodarone or sotolol
- Cardioversion if medical therapy fails (quickly) – will need sedation
- Consider pacing if cardioversion no effective
- Evaluation and treatment of cause (usually IHD)
- If associated with long QT -> consider Mg2+
