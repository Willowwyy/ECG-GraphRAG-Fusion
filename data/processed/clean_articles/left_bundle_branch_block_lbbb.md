# Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB)
- QRS duration ≥ 120ms
- Dominant S wave in V1
- Broad monophasic R wave in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5-6)
- Absence of Q waves in lateral leads
- Prolonged R wave peak time > 60ms in leads V5-6
Associated features include:
- Left axis deviation (LAD);
- Poor R wave progression in precordial leads, and
- Appropriate discordance (discussed below)
In normal cardiac conduction, impulses travel equally down the left and right bundles, with the septum activated from left to right and the formation of small Q waves in lateral leads
- In LBBB, conduction delay means that impulses travel first via the right bundle branch to the RV, and then to the LV via the septum
- Septal activation is thus reversed eliminating lateral Q waves
- The overall depolarisation vector from the right to left ventricle produces tall R waves in lateral leads (I, V5-6) and deep S waves in the right precordial leads (V1-3). The delay between activation of the RV and LV produces the characteristic “M-shaped” R wave seen in lateral leads
- Delayed overall conduction time to the LV extends the QRS duration to ≥ 120 ms
- rS complex (small R wave, deep S wave)
- QS complex (deep Q/S wave with no preceding R wave)
- Appropriate discordance refers to the fact that abnormal depolarisation should be followed by abnormal repolarisation, which appears discordant to the preceding QRS complex
- Lateral leads with tall, broad R waves will often have associated ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion, and those with deep S waves can have an allowable amount of ST elevation that does not indicate ischaemia (generally viewed as < 25% of the size of the preceding S wave)
