# Premature Ventricular Complex (PVC)
A premature ventricular complex (PVC) is a premature beat arising from an ectopic focus within the ventricles. AKA: ventricular ectopics, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular premature beats, ventricular premature depolarisations.
- Broad QRS complex (≥ 120 ms) with abnormal morphology
- Premature — i.e. occurs earlier than would be expected for the next sinus impulse
- Discordant ST segment and T wave changes.
- Usually followed by a full compensatory pause
- Groups of pacemaker cells throughout the conducting system are capable of spontaneous depolarisation
- The rate of depolarisation decreases from top to bottom: fastest at the sinoatrial node; slowest within the ventricles
- Ectopic impulses from subsidiary pacemakers are normally suppressed by more rapid impulses from above
- Premature contractions (“ectopics”) are classified by their origin — atrial (PACs), junctional (PJCs) or ventricular (PVCs)
- Ectopic firing of a focus within the ventricles bypasses the His-Purkinje system and depolarises the ventricles directly
- This disrupts the normal sequence of cardiac activation, leading to asynchronous activation of the two ventricles
- The consequent interventricular conduction delay produces QRS complexes with prolonged duration and abnormal morphology
Appropriate discordance describes a pattern of repolarisation abnormality (typically seen with left bundle branch block, paced rhythms, VT) in which the ST segment and T wave are directed opposite to the main vector of the QRS complex. Because there is abnormal depolarisation, there is subsequent abnormal repolarisation which is discordant:
- ST depression and T wave inversion in leads with a dominant R wave
- ST elevation with upright T waves in leads with a dominant S wave
With a full compensatory pause, the next normal beat arrives after an interval that is equal to double the preceding R-R interval
Retrograde capture describes the process whereby the ectopic impulse is conducted retrogradely through the AV node, producing atrial depolarisation. This is visible on the ECG as an inverted P wave (“retrograde P wave“), usually occurring after the QRS complex.
PVCs are said to be “frequent” if there are more than 5 PVCs per minute on the routine ECG, or more than 10-30 per hour during ambulatory monitoring.
- Unifocal — arising from a single ectopic focus; each PVC is identical
- Multifocal — arising from two or more ectopic foci; multiple QRS morphologies
The origin of each PVC can be discerned from the QRS morphology:
- PVCs arising from the right ventricle have a left bundle branch block morphology (dominant S wave in V1)
- PVCs arising from the left ventricle have a right bundle branch block morphology (dominant R wave in V1)
PVCs often occur in repeating patterns:
- Bigeminy — every other beat is a PVC
- Trigeminy — every third beat is a PVC
- Quadrigeminy — every fourth beat is a PVC
- Couplet — two consecutive PVCs
- NSVT — between three and thirty consecutive PVCs (see below)
- PVCs are a normal electrophysiological phenomenon not usually requiring investigation or treatment
- Anxiety
- Sympathomimetics
- Beta-agonists
- Excess caffeine
- Hypokalaemia
- Hypomagnesaemia
- Digoxin toxicity
- Myocardial ischemia
- Sinus rhythm with PVCs of two different morphologies (arrows)
- Note the appropriately discordant ST segments / T waves
- The pause surrounding the PVC is equal to double the preceding R-R interval (= a full compensatory pause)
When is a PVC not a PVC?
- Definitions vary regarding 3 or more PVCs
- Some authors define three PVCs as a triplet of PVCs; whilst others describe this as a ‘short burst of VT’; but more commonly as NSVT
- A consensus definition would be: 3-30 consecutive PVCs with a rate >100bpm described as non-sustained VT (ventricular rhythm if rate <100bpm)
- Premature atrial complexes (PACs)
- Premature junctional complexes (PJCs)
