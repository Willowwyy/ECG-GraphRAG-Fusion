# AV Block: 2nd degree, Mobitz I (Wenckebach Phenomenon)
Progressive prolongation of the PR interval culminating in a non-conducted P wave:
- PR interval is longest immediately before dropped beat
- PR interval is shortest immediately after dropped beat
- The P-P interval remains relatively constant
- The greatest increase in PR interval duration is typically between the first and second beats of the cycle
- The RR interval progressively shortens with each beat of the cycle
- The Wenckebach pattern tends to repeat in P:QRS groups with ratios of 3:2, 4:3 or 5:4
- Mobitz I is usually due to reversible conduction block at the level of the AV node
- Malfunctioning AV nodal cells tend to progressively fatigue until they fail to conduct an impulse. This is different to cells of the His-Purkinje system which tend to fail suddenly and unexpectedly (i.e. producing a Mobitz II block)
- Drugs: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, amiodarone
- Increased vagal tone (e.g. athletes)
- Inferior MI
- Myocarditis
- Following cardiac surgery (mitral valve repair, Tetralogy of Fallot repair)
- Mobitz I is usually a benign rhythm, causing minimal haemodynamic disturbance and with low risk of progression to third degree heart block
- Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment
- Symptomatic patients usually respond to atropine
- Permanent pacing is rarely required
Mobitz I AV block
- Progressive prolongation of PR interval, with a subsequent non-conducted P wave
- Repeating 5:4 conduction ratio of P waves to QRS complexes
- Relatively constant P-P interval despite irregularity of QRS complexes
The first clue to the presence of Mobitz I AV block on this ECG is the way the QRS complexes cluster into groups, separated by short pauses. This phenomenon usually represents 2nd-degree AV block or non-conducted PACs; occasionally SA exit block.
Thanks to Dr Harry Patterson, FACEM, for providing this ECG.
Mobitz I AV block
- QRS complexes clustered in groups, separated by non-conducted P waves.
- The P:QRS conduction ratio varies from 5:4 to 6:5.
- Note the difference in PR interval between the first and last QRS complex of each group.
Mobitz I AV block associated with inferior STEMI and RV infarction
- The majority of the rhythm strip shows 2:1 AV conduction, which makes discerning the type of block difficult (i.e. it could represent Mobitz I or Mobitz II)
- However, there is a single 3:2 Mobitz I cycle visible in the middle of the rhythm strip (QRS complexes 5 + 6). If you look hard, you can see a non-conducted P wave deforming the downslope of the T wave in complex 6
- Continuous rhythm strip recording revealed that this patient was indeed in Mobitz I AV block
Mobitz I in a patient with atrial pacing following mitral valve surgery
- Small atrial pacing spikes precede the QRS complexes.
- The interval between the pacing spikes increases progressively until there is a non-conducted pacing spike.
