# Ventricular Fibrillation
OVERVIEW
- requires a initiating stimulus in a susceptible myocardium.
CAUSES
- Electrical (electrocution, lightning, trauma)
- Ischaemia/hypoxic susceptibility (respiratory arrest)
- Electrolyte abnormality (low K and Mg)
- Altered autonomic and vagal inputs
- Mechanical stimuli (wire or catheter in RV)
- Congenital susceptibility (conduction abnormalities)
- Acquired disorders (ischaemia, hypertrophy, myocarditis, pro-arrhythmic drugs)
MANAGEMENT
- Early defibrillation (monophasic/biphasic – max J)
- Correction of cause (wire, electrolytes, hypoxemia)
- CPR (with minimal interruption)
- Ventilation
- Anti-arrhythmics
