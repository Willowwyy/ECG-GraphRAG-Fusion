# Focal Atrial Tachycardia (FAT)
Focal atrial tachycardia (FAT) is a form of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) originating from a single ectopic focus within the atria but outside of the sinus node
- The term FAT is commonly used synonymously with atrial tachycardia, a broader term referring to any form of SVT originating within the atria but outside of the sinus node
- FAT, atrial flutter and multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) are all forms of atrial tachycardia
- Management of the three types varies and thus distinguishing between them is clinically important
- Due to a single ectopic focus
- The underlying mechanism can involve increased automaticity, triggered activity or reentry
- Multiple causes including: Digoxin toxicity Atrial scarring due to ischaemic heart disease Catecholamine excess Stimulants including cocaine, caffeine Alcohol Congenital abnormalities Idiopathic
- Digoxin toxicity
- Atrial scarring due to ischaemic heart disease
- Catecholamine excess
- Stimulants including cocaine, caffeine
- Alcohol
- Congenital abnormalities
- Idiopathic
- Atrial rate > 100 bpm
- Abnormal P wave morphology and axis (e.g. inverted in inferior leads) due to ectopic origin
- Unifocal, identical P waves
- Isoelectric baseline (unlike atrial flutter)
- Normal QRS morphology (unless pre-existing bundle branch block, accessory pathway, or rate-related aberrant conduction)
Focal atrial tachycardia:
- There is a narrow complex tachycardia at 120 bpm
- Each QRS complex is preceded by an abnormal P wave — upright in V1, inverted in the inferior leads II, III and aVF
- P wave morphology is consistent throughout
Focal atrial tachycardia:
- There is a narrow complex tachycardia at 95 bpm
- Each QRS complex is preceded by an abnormal P wave — biphasic in V1; inverted in the inferior leads II, III and aVF; and inverted V3-V6
- P wave morphology is consistent throughout
- Supraventricular tachycardia
- Atrial flutter
- Atrial fibrillation
- Accelerated Junctional Rhythm
