# Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB)
- Left axis deviation (usually -45 to -90 degrees)
- qR complexes in leads I, aVL
- rS complexes in leads II, III, aVF
- Prolonged R wave peak time in aVL > 45ms
Typical ECG of LAFB, demonstrating:
- rS complexes in leads II, III, aVF, with small R waves and deep S waves
- qR complexes in leads I, aVL, with small Q waves and tall R waves
- Left Axis Deviation (LAD): Leads II, III and aVF are NEGATIVE; Leads I and aVL are POSITIVE
Associated features include:
- QRS duration normal or slightly prolonged (80-110ms)
- Increased QRS voltage in limb leads
In LAFB, impulses are conducted to the left ventricle (LV) via the posterior fascicle, which inserts into the inferoseptal wall of the LV along its endocardial surface
- Depolarisation spreads from endocardium to epicardium and thus the initial vector is directed downwards and rightwards, towards inferior leads. This produces small R waves in leads II, III and aVF, and small Q waves in leads I and aVL
- The major wave of depolarisation is slightly delayed and spreads upwards and leftwards, producing tall R waves in left-sided leads and deep S waves in inferior leads
- This overall delay of approximately 20ms (compared with normal simultaneous conduction via both fascicles) results in a slight widening of the QRS
- Because impulses reach the left-sided leads later than normal, there is an increase R wave peak time in aVL (time from onset of QRS to peak of R wave)
Sequence of conduction in LAFB
- YELLOW line: Impulses are conducted to the left ventricle via the posterior fascicle
- RED arrow: Initial depolarisation vector is directed towards inferior leads
- BLUE arrow : Major depolarisation vector, which is slightly delayed, is directed towards left-sided leads
