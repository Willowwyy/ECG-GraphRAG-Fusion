# Atrial Fibrillation
OVERVIEW
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained dysrhythmia and is characterised by disorganised atrial electrical activity and contraction resulting in an “irregularly irregular” ventricular response (“fibrillation waves”)
- AF has multiple possible underlying causes
- The incidence and prevalence of AF is increasing, with a lifetime risk for people over the age of 40 years of ~25%
- AF prevalence increases with age
- AF is a common occurrence post cardiac surgery (10-40%, typically day 2 to 3)
CAUSE
The classification below is according to pathophysiological mechanism
- Alternatively, can causes can be classified according to a ‘surgical sieve’ (e.g. vascular, inflammatory, trauma, etc)
Catecholamine excess or increased sensitivity
- Exogenous (eg. adrenaline infusion, hydrocarbon exposure)
- Endogenous Subarachnoid haemorrhage Stress Phaeochromocytoma Thyrotoxicosis
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage
- Stress
- Phaeochromocytoma
- Thyrotoxicosis
Atrial distension
- Pulmonary hypertension primary secondary, such as OSA, PE, pulmonary fibrosis
- primary
- secondary, such as OSA, PE, pulmonary fibrosis
- Septal defects
- Valvular disease (e.g. mitral stenosis), including infective endocarditis
Abnormality of conducting system
- Congenital cardiac disease, eg. septal defect
- Infiltrative cardiac disease, eg. amyloidosis, sarcoidosis
- Ischaemic heart disease
- Age-related fibrotic changes
- Haemochromatosis/iron overload
- Hypothermia
Increased atrial automaticity / irritation
- Alcohol (“holiday heart”)
- Caffeine
- Catecholamines
- Electrolyte derangement (hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia)
- Myocarditis
COMPLICATIONS
Adverse effects on haemodynamics:
- loss of atrial systole (aka “atrial kick”) (normally responsible for about 20% of ventricular filling)
- Decreased diastolic filling time due to tachycardia
- Rate-related cardiomyopathy (can occur over weeks)
Atrial thrombus formation
- Systemic embolism, especially stroke
- Pulmonary embolism
Annual risk of embolic stroke from AF
- The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is recommended for estimating the risk of stroke (Lip et al, 2002; January et al, 2014)
- There are 3 categories: score 0: negligible risk of stroke (~ 0%/y) (very few patients!) score 1: 1.3%/y risk of stroke score >1 (2 or more): >2.2% risk of stroke (high risk category)
- score 0: negligible risk of stroke (~ 0%/y) (very few patients!)
- score 1: 1.3%/y risk of stroke
- score >1 (2 or more): >2.2% risk of stroke (high risk category)
- The maximum score of 9 predicts a 15.2%/y risk of stroke
- A CHA2DS2VASC calculator is available on MDCalc
INVESTIGATIONS
Bedside
- 12 lead ECG
- blood gas (e.g. hypokalaemia)
Laboratory
- UEC (e.g. hypokalaemia)
- CaMgPO4 (e.g. hypomagnesemia)
- FBC (e.g. anaemia)
- TFTs (e.g. hyperthyroidism)
Imaging
- CXR (e.g. cardiomegaly, atrial dilation, pulmonary odema, other lung disease)
- Echocardiography (e.g. structural heart disease, TOE to exclude atrial thrombus)
MANAGEMENT
Resuscitation
- address life threats, determine if stable or unstable
- Unstable features (if significant and attributable to AF) chest pain dyspnoea heart failure hypotension
- chest pain
- dyspnoea
- heart failure
- hypotension
- provide procedural sedation
Specific treatments for stable AF patients (see below)
- rate control versus rhythm control
- anticoagulation
Seek and treat underlying cause and complications
- replace electrolytes (e.g. K > 4 mmol/L, Mg > 0.9 mmol/L)
- treat cause (e.g. ischaemia, sepsis, thyroid function)
Ablation therapy is indicated if:
- permanent AF where ventricular rate difficult to control and persistent symptoms/LV dysfunction
- rate-related cardiomyopathy due to refractory AF
- refractory symptomatic paroxysmal AF
Disposition
- cardiology referral for patients requiring specialist follow-up
- patients with a significant underlying cause or comorbidities require admission to hospital some require cardiac monitoring those with critical illness require HDU/ ICU
- some require cardiac monitoring
- those with critical illness require HDU/ ICU
RATE CONTROL VERSUS RHYTHM CONTROL
Rate control with anticoagulation is the strategy of choice, rather than rhythm control, for most patients
- Prior to the 2000s, rhythm control was preferred due to theoretical benefits from preventing cardiac remodelling due to chronic AF
- However, rate control was supported by a number of studies from the early 2000s (AFFRIM, RACE, STAF, and PIAF)
- A subsequent meta-analysis of 8 high-quality studies (n=7499) by Caldeira et al, 2012 found: no clear survival benefit for rate control over rhythm control composite endpoint (death, stroke and recurrent hospitalisation) favours rate-control
- no clear survival benefit for rate control over rhythm control
- composite endpoint (death, stroke and recurrent hospitalisation) favours rate-control
Rate control strategies
- Recommendations based on the 2014 AHA guideline: β-blocker or calcium channel blocker for paroxysmal AF can be given IV if hemodynamically stable (CCBs preferred in COPD patients) IV amiodarone for critically ill patients AV nodal blockade (e.g. BB, CCB, amiodarone) is not recommended in patients with pre-excitation (e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White) – procainamide (not widely available in Australia) or electrical cardioversion is the better choice avoid calcium channel blockers in decompensated heart failure (digoxin or amiodarone are preferred). Combination of digoxin and a β-blocker recommended for long-term management of compensated heart failure patients. target a rate of 80 as the endpoint, however, higher rates (e.g. ~110/min) are acceptable in stable patients with preserved LV function
- β-blocker or calcium channel blocker for paroxysmal AF can be given IV if hemodynamically stable (CCBs preferred in COPD patients)
- can be given IV if hemodynamically stable (CCBs preferred in COPD patients)
- IV amiodarone for critically ill patients
- AV nodal blockade (e.g. BB, CCB, amiodarone) is not recommended in patients with pre-excitation (e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White) – procainamide (not widely available in Australia) or electrical cardioversion is the better choice
- avoid calcium channel blockers in decompensated heart failure (digoxin or amiodarone are preferred). Combination of digoxin and a β-blocker recommended for long-term management of compensated heart failure patients.
- target a rate of 80 as the endpoint, however, higher rates (e.g. ~110/min) are acceptable in stable patients with preserved LV function
- Digoxin is slow acting and ineffective in patients with increased sympathetic tone (most critically ill patients)
Rhythm control strategies
- DC cardioversion essential in unstable patients is also an effective strategy when performed electively using procedural sedation within 48 hours of AF onset or later following adequate anticoagulation and TOE
- essential in unstable patients
- is also an effective strategy when performed electively using procedural sedation within 48 hours of AF onset or later following adequate anticoagulation and TOE
- Pharmacological options for cardioversion can be used in hemodynamically stable patients amiodarone flecanide (only an option in structurally normal hearts, as associated with sudden cardiac death in structurally abnormal hearts) propafenone vernakalant
- amiodarone
- flecanide (only an option in structurally normal hearts, as associated with sudden cardiac death in structurally abnormal hearts)
- propafenone
- vernakalant
- Options for maintenance of sinus rhythm inlcude: amiodarone disopyramide flecanide sotolol
- amiodarone
- disopyramide
- flecanide
- sotolol
ANTICOAGULATION STRATEGIES
2014 AHA recommendations for anticoagulation:
- If AF >48 hours: therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g. IV heparin, enoxaparin)
- Anticoagulation should continue for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after TOE-cardioversion aspirin is an option if CHA2DS2-VASc score =1 Warfarin (INR 2-3) or equivalent if CHA2DS2-VASc score >1 (e.g. all patients >75-years-old)
- aspirin is an option if CHA2DS2-VASc score =1
- Warfarin (INR 2-3) or equivalent if CHA2DS2-VASc score >1 (e.g. all patients >75-years-old)
The effectiveness of different anticoagulation therapies for stroke prevention per year:
- Warfarin: RRR 62%; ARR 2.8%
- Aspirin: RRR 22%; ARR 1.5%
- Warfarin plus aspirin: no additional benefit over warfarin alone
- Dabigatran: RRR 35% compared to warfarin
Benefits of anticoagulation should always be weighed against the harms (e.g. falls risk, coexistent bleeding diathesis)
- No anticoagulation is also reasonable if there is increased bleeding risk and/or AF is likely transient (e.g. post-cardiac surgery, many ICU patients)
